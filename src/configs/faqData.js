    question: "Why Binance?",
    answer: ["For us it’s a big part of the bridging process where we can realise value almost immediately. Without giving away our entire strategy, that’s all I can really say. It’s also cheap and easy to roll out on."]

    question: "How does it work?",

    question: "What’s happening behind the scenes? ",
    answer: ["Our team has some very experienced leverage traders. We" +
    " have been early adopters of Abracadabra Money and are excited to go to work for our Baby Spell Frog holders.", "We wanted to bring something to the Frog Nation that doesn’t involve luck or winning something. It’s simply about holding and waiting, and that’s all you need to do in order to get a monthly payment in MIM. It is still a degen play however, read the Whitepaper for the breakdown."]

    question: "What does the next 12 months look like?",

  {
    question: "What was the inspiration?",
    answer: ["We knew we were going to offer our expertise in Abracadabra somehow, we just didn’t know what the" +
    " front of house would look like.", "As we decided on an NFT, a slew of other Frog NFT’s launched which we loved.", "We felt like we are offering a SMART NFT to the Frog Nation so why not a frog.", "The idea to make it a baby frog came from the fact they are cute, we feel like both the demand and market for frogs was justifiable."]

    question: "How big is the team?",
